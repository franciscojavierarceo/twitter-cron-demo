# twitter-cron-demo

This is a repository showing how to run a cron job using github actions to send a tweet everyday.

You will need to creata `.env` file to run this locally that looks like:

```
TWITTER_API_KEY=
TWITTER_API_SECRET=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=
```

Except you'll have to actually put in your credentials that you get from your Twitter developer dashboard.
